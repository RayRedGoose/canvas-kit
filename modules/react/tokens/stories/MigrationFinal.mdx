# Q&A and more

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### 1. Forgetting CSS Variable Imports

**Problem**: Styles don't apply because CSS variables aren't defined. **Solution**: Ensure you've
imported the CSS variable files at your app's top level.

### 2. Not Using var() Wrapper

**Problem**: CSS properties don't work with raw token values. **Solution**: Use `createStyles` or
`cssVar` utility instead of direct token references.

### 3. Mixing Old and New Tokens

**Problem**: Inconsistent styling and potential conflicts. **Solution**: Migrate completely to new
tokens rather than mixing systems.

### 4. Using Base Tokens for Everything

**Problem**: Missing out on theming capabilities. **Solution**: Prefer system tokens for their
semantic meaning and theming support.

## Incremental Migration Strategy

1. **Start with New Projects**: Use new tokens for all new components and features
2. **Component-by-Component**: Migrate existing components one at a time
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure visual consistency after each component migration
4. **Update Style Patterns**: Migrate from style props to `createStyles` where needed
5. **Consolidate Imports**: Remove old token imports once migration is complete

## Next Steps

After completing the token migration:

- Review your components for consistent use of system tokens
- Consider implementing theming if not already in place
- Update your team's coding standards to reflect new token usage
- Monitor for any visual regressions and address them promptly
