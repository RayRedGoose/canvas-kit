## Usage

### PrimaryButton

<SymbolDescription name="PrimaryButton" fileName="/react/" />

The example below shows multiple instances of a `PrimaryButton` with various icon configurations.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

Primary Buttons also have an `inverse` variant. While it looks similar to the default Secondary
Button, the default outline as well as the hover and focus states are different. Use this variant
when you need to place a Primary Button on a dark or colorful background such as `blueberry400`.

### Custom Styles

We understand that there are instances in which consumers might need to adjust styles for specific
use cases. All of our buttons extend our lower level base button props which extends style
properties that come from `Box`. Below are some examples in which you can overwrite styles for all
of our buttons. Please use this sparingly and try to adhere to the design system.

### Accessible Use of the `as` Prop

Like many of our components, Buttons accept an `as` prop, which lets you change the underlying
semantic element - usually an `<a>`, or a `<button>`. This should be done with caution to ensure the
best accessibility. Generally, `<button>` elements should be used for actions, and `<a>` elements
should be used for navigation.
