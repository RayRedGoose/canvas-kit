# Canvas Kit Expandable

`Expandable` is a compound component that creates a header to expand or collapse related content.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-labs-react
```

## Usage

### Start Icon

For a basic expandable container with a chevron icon before the title, place`Expandable.Icon` before
`Expandable.Title` as children of `Expandable.Target` and pass the `iconPosition` prop to
`Expandable.Icon` with a value of `start`. `Expandable.Icon` will use a right chevron icon when
collapsed and a down chevron icon when expanded.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={ExpandableStories.StartIcon} />

### End Icon

For an expandable container with a chevron icon after the title, place `Expandable.Title` before
`Expandable.Icon` as children of `Expandable.Target` and pass the `iconPosition` prop to
`Expandable.Icon` with a value of `end`. `Expandable.Icon` will use a down chevron icon when
collapsed and an up chevron icon when expanded.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={ExpandableStories.EndIcon} />

### With Avatar

To include an avatar image, `Expandable.Avatar` should be placed between `Expandable.Icon` and
`Expandable.Title`. An `iconPosition` prop with a value of either `start` or `end` should be passed
to `Expandable.Icon` depending on whether the `Expandable.Icon` is placed before or after
`Expandable.Title`.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={ExpandableStories.Avatar} />

### Right to Left (RTL)

Expandable container has bidirectional support and should function as expected with RTL languages as
long as the content direction is set in your Canvas theme.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={ExpandableStories.RTL} />

### Depth

The `depth` prop passed to `Expandable` allows you to adjust the visual elevation of a component
using our depth tokens.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={ExpandableStories.Depth} />

### Title Wrap

Long titles will wrap to the next line and increase the height of the container.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={ExpandableStories.LongTitle} />

You can also have direct access to the model if

### Hoisted Model

If you you need direct access to the model, you can hoist it with the `useExpandableModel` hook. In
the example below, we're hoisting the models to expand and collapse all three containers at once.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={ExpandableStories.HoistedModel} />
