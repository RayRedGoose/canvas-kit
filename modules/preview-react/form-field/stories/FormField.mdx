# Canvas Kit Form Field

FormField allows users to wrap input components to make them accessible. You can customize the field
by passing in `TextInput`, `Select`, `RadioGroup` and other form elements to `FormField.Input`.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-preview-react
```

## Usage

### Basic

Form Field should be used in tandem with most Canvas Kit input components to ensure they meet
accessibility standards. The orientation of the label by default is `vertical`.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={FormFieldStories.Basic} />

### Error States

Set the `error` prop of the Form Field or define it in the model to indicate it has an error.
`error` accepts the following values:

`"error" | "alert" | undefined`

### Alert

Use the alert state when a value is valid but there is additional information.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={FormFieldStories.Alert} />

### Error

Use the error state when the value is no longer valid.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={FormFieldStories.Error} />

### Disabled

Set the `disabled` prop of `FormField.Input` to prevent users from interacting with it.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={FormFieldStories.Disabled} />

### Hint

Use `FormField.Hint` to display a short message below the input component and `FormField.Container`
to ensure proper alignment.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={FormFieldStories.Hint} />

### Label Position Horizontal

Set the `orientation` prop of the Form Field to designate the position of the label relative to the
input component. By default, the orientation will be set to `vertical`.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={FormFieldStories.LabelPositionHorizontal} />

### Grow

Set the `grow` prop of the Form Field to `true` to configure it (including the wrapped input
component) to expand to the width of its container.

**Note: This Prop is deprecated and will be removed in a future major version.**

<ExampleCodeBlock of={FormFieldStories.Grow} />

### Ref Forwarding

If you need full customization you can use the `FormField` behavior hooks to build your own
solution. It is also easy it work with custom components or third party libraries and get the CKR
accessibility guarantees by using the `as` prop.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={FormFieldStories.RefForwarding} />

### Required

Set the `isRequired` prop of the Form Field to `true` to indicate that the field is required. Labels
for required fields are suffixed by a red asterisk.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={FormFieldStories.Required} />

### Field Set

Set the `as` prop of the `FormField` to `fieldset` and the `as` prop of the `FormField.Label` to
`legend` when using `RadioGroup` to ensure proper accessbility.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={FormFieldStories.FieldSet} />

### Custom

If you need full customization you can use the `FormField` behavior hooks to build your own
solution. It is also easy it work with custom components or third party libraries and get the CKR
accessibility guarantees by using the `as` prop.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={FormFieldStories.Custom} />

### Custom id

Form Field will automatically generate an HTML `id` for its input element to link it to the
correponding label. Alternatively, you may set the `id` prop of the Form Field to specify a custom
`id` for the input element. The `id` will be appended by `input-${your-unique-id}`.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={FormFieldStories.CustomId} />

### All Fields

Form Field should allow you to use it with all `inputs` including `Select`, `TextInput`, `Checkbox`,
`TextArea`, `Switch`, and `RadioGroup`.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={FormFieldStories.AllFields} />

### Themed Errors

You can theme your error rings by wrapping an input in a `CanvasProvider` and defining
`focusOutline` and `error` properties on the `theme`.

<ExampleCodeBlock of={FormFieldStories.ThemedError} />

### Custom Styles

Form Field and its subcomponents support custom styling via the `cs` prop. For more information,
