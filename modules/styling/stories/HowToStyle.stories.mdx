# How To Customize Styles

There are multiple ways to customize styles for our components within Canvas Kit. What approach you
choose depends on your use case. Ranging from some simple overrides to fully custom solutions, here
are the following options.

- [Simple customization](#simple-customization)
  - [Using `cs` Prop](using-cs-prop)
  - [Using `createStyles`](using-createStyles)
- [Customizing Via Stencil Extension](customizing-via-stencil-extension) -
  [Overriding Variables](overriding-variables)

## Simple Customization

### Using `cs` Prop

The `cs` prop takes in a single, or an array of values that are created by the `cs` function, a
string representing a CSS class name, or the return of the `createVars` function. It merges
everything together and applies `className` and `style` attributes to a React element. Components
that support the `cs` prop allow you to quickly update styles for simple customizations.

```tsx
import {value cssVar} from '@workday/canvas-kit-styling';
import {value system} from '@workday/canvas-tokens-web';

<Text cs={{textTransform: 'uppercase', margin: cssVar(system.space.x4)}}>My uppercased text</Text>;
```

### Using `createStyles`

`createStyles` creates CSS styles based on object-style input. It has a side-effect of adding CSS to
the page and will return a space-delimitated string of CSS class names meant to be added to an
element. This utilities also handles wrapping our tokens in `var(--${tokenName})`. Use this
utilities when you have a more complex style object with possible nested selectors.

```tsx
import {createStyles} from '@workday/canvas-kit-styling';
import {system} from '@workday/canvas-tokens-web';

const textStyles = createStyles({
  margin: system.space.x4,
  '&:hover': {
    transform: 'scale(2)',
  },
  span: {
    color: system.color.text.strong
  }
});

<Text cs={textStyles}>
  My uppercased text with
  <span>{hover effect}</span>
</Text>;
```

> **Note:** You don't need to wrap our token variables like `system.space.x4` in `cssVar` because
> `createStyles` handles that for you. If you're in the context of the `cs` prop, you need to wrap
> css variables.

## Customizing Via Stencil Extension

Most of our components use
[Stencils](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-basics--create-stencil) to
define styles. Similar to our models, Stencils are built to be flexibile, reusable and easy to
modify.

### Overriding Variables

Often times, styles can be dynamic resulting in component Stencils exposing CSS variables that can
be used to override styles. Our Buttons are a great example of how to do this.

In the example below, we're using the variables exposed by `buttonStencil` which is used to build
our `PrimaryButton` and changing the variables to completely overrite styles for different visual
states. Overriding styles in this way abstracts out the need to know the underlying dom structure of
our Buttons while giving you access to style effectively and predictably.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CustomButton} />

## Stencils extentions

Base Button, Card, Svg and Text components share their setSyntheticTrailingComments, so you can
build your component under it by extending stencil.

### Custom Card

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CustomCard} />

### Custom Icon

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CustomIcon} />

### Custom Text

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CustomText} />
