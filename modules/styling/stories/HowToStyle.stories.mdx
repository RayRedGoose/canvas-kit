# How To Customize Styles

There are multiple ways to customize styles for our components within Canvas Kit. What approach you
choose depends on your use case. Ranging from some simple overrides to fully custom solutions, here
are the following options.

- [Simple customization](#simple-customization)
  - [Using `cs` Prop](using-cs-prop)
  - [Using `createStyles`](using-createStyles)
- [Leveraging Component CSS Variables](leveraging-component-css-variables)
- Stencils Extentions

## Simple Customization

### Using `cs` Prop

The `cs` prop takes in a single, or an array of values that are created by the `cs` function, a
string representing a CSS class name, or the return of the `createVars` function. It merges
everything together and applies `className` and `style` attributes to a React element. Components
that support the `cs` prop allow you to quickly update styles for simple customizations.

```tsx
import {cssVar} from '@workday/canvas-kit-styling';
import {system} from '@workday/canvas-tokens-web';

<Text cs={{textTransform: 'uppercase', margin: cssVar(system.space.x4)}}>My uppercased text</Text>;
```

### Using `createStyles`

`createStyles` creates CSS styles based on object-style input. It has a side-effect of adding CSS to
the page and will return a space-delimitated string of CSS class names meant to be added to an
element. This utilities also handles wrapping our tokens in `var(--${tokenName})`. Use this
utilities when you have a more complex style object with possible nested selectors.

```tsx
import {createStyles} from '@workday/canvas-kit-styling';
import {system} from '@workday/canvas-tokens-web';

const textStyles = createStyles({
  margin: system.space.x4,
  '&:hover': {
    transform: 'scale(2)',
  },
  span: {
    color: system.color.text.strong
  }
});

<Text cs={textStyles}>
  My uppercased text with
  <span>{hover effect}</span>
</Text>;
```

> **Note:** You don't need to wrap our token variables like `system.space.x4` in `cssVar` because
> `createStyles` handles that for you. If you're in the context of the `cs` prop, you need to wrap
> css variables.

## Leveraging Component CSS Variables

Some of Canvas components are built using stencils and support its own CSS variables. There is a
list of these components:

- Buttons have the next stencil variables: `background` as the background color, `border` as the
  border color, `boxShadowInner` as the focus ring inner shadow color, `boxShadowOuter` the focus
  ring outer shadow color, `label` as the label color, `opacity`, `borderRadius`

- Icons have the next stencil variables: `width` to set svg width, `height` to set svg height,
  `size` to set svg width and height with the same value.

  - In addition to all icon variables `SystemIcon` also supports `color` to set color for
    `.wd-icon-fill` and `.wd-icon-accent` (if `accentColor` is not provided), `accentColor` to set
    color for `.wd-icon-accent`, `backgroundColor` to set color for svg background.

  - In addition to all icon variables `AccentIcon` also supports `color` to set color for svg.

  - In addition to all icon variables `AppletIcon` also supports `color200` to set color for
    `.color-200`, `color300` to set color for `.color-300`, `color400` to set color for
    `.color-400`, `color500` to set color for `.color-500`. Please note, these colors should be the
    same color but different shades. For example, if `color200` has been change to `blueberry200`,
    all others must be assigned to blueberry shades (300, 400, 500).

You can reassign any CSS variable for the specific component or underlying components using `cs`
prop:

<ExampleCodeBlock code={StyledButton} />

## Stencils extentions

Base Button, Card, Svg and Text components share their setSyntheticTrailingComments, so you can
build your component under it by extending stencil.

### Custom Button

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CustomButton} />

### Custom Card

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CustomCard} />

### Custom Icon

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CustomIcon} />

### Custom Text

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CustomText} />
